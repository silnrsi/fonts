jq is a json processor (https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
Here are some possibly useful queries to run against families.json:

Find all fonts which are redistributable (along with the download URL and the version):
jq 'map({family: .family, distributable: .distributable | select( . != false ), source: .source, packageurl: .packageurl, version: .version })' families.json 

Find all fonts which are not redistributable:
jq 'map({family: .family, distributable: .distributable | select( . != true ), source: .source})' families.json 

Find all fonts which are not released under the OFL:
jq 'map({family: .family, license: .license | select( . != "OFL" ), source: .source})' families.json 

Find all fonts which status is not current:
jq 'map({family: .family, status: .status | select( . != "current" ), source: .source})' families.json 

Find all fonts for which licensing is not clearly provided:
jq 'map({family: .family, source: .source, license: .license | select( . == null )})' families.json 

Find all fonts for which the version number is not provided:
jq 'map({family: .family, version: .version | select( . == null  ), status: .status | select( . != "deprecated"), source: .source})' families.json

Find out about the fallback status of all fonts (including null):
jq 'map({family: .family, status: .status, fallback: .fallback})' families.json

Get some numbers on the licensing landscape (using the miller filter from https://github.com/johnkerl/miller):
jq 'map({family: .family, license: .license, source: .source})' families.json | mlr --ijson --ocsv uniq -c -g license then sort -f license then sort -nr count
