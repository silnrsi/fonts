    <p>For more details on the issue with Bold weights see <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Using Axis-Based Font Families</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs"><em>Why does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and dialogs?</em></h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold. To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using the application's UI controls such as a "B" button.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold"><em>Why do I sometimes get a fake Bold?</em></h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications will make a "fake" Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the font (SemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold). This is because only Regular has an associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with some apps and OSes. If you are using some other weight than Regular for text and want to make a word or phrase stand out you will need to select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually.</p>
    <h3 id="why-does-the-font-not-work-in-microsoft-word"><em>Why does the font not work in Microsoft Word?</em></h3>
    <p>Microsoft needed to fix a bug that affected Limbu script fonts, such as Namdhinggo. This fix is not avaliable in Windows 10, but is present in Windows 11.</p>
