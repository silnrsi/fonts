    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Ramsina:</p>
    <h4 id="how-is-this-font-different-from-east-syriac-marcus"><em>How
    is this font different from East Syriac Marcus?</em></h4>
    <p>This font was based on the design of the Syriac characters in
    East Syriac Marcus.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The outlines have been cleaned up or redrawn.</li>
    <li>The Latin characters were imported from Crimson Pro.</li>
    <li>The default isolate designs of <em>kaph</em>, <em>mim</em>, and
    <em>nun</em> have been modified. Since isolate forms for these
    characters do not exist in modern typefaces, a variety of different
    designs have been created for the isolate forms. The default forms
    in this font are the most prevalent, but the original forms from
    East Syriac Marcus are still available through a Stylistic Set.</li>
    <li>The font has added support for alternates, ligatures, and
    diacritics that the East Syriac style requires.</li>
    <li>The design of two characters, U+0738 (dotted zlama horizontal)
    and U+0739 (dotted zlama angular), have been swapped to follow the
    Unicode Standard design.</li>
    <li>U+0740 (feminine dot) has been reverted to use the single dot,
    and U+0324 (diaeresis below) was added to support the double dot
    below.</li>
    <li>It also supports the Syriac abbreviation mark which is rendered
    by a line with a dot at each end and in the center.</li>
    <li>This font was updated to use a more modern build system so that
    it can be easily updated in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="why-does-the-bold-weight-look-so-fuzzy"><em>Why does the
    Bold weight look so fuzzy?</em></h4>
    <p>Because Ramsina is already quite heavy, it does not come with a
    Bold weight. If you tried to turn on Bold using the application’s UI
    controls such as a “B” button you will get what is called “fake”
    Bold. This will not look good. It would be better to use underlining
    or to choose another font in order to show emphasis.</p>
    <h3
    id="i-notice-that-this-font-is-missing-072d..072f-074d..074f-and-the-characters-from-the-syriac-supplement-block-0860..086f.-will-you-add-them"><em>I
    notice that this font is missing 072D..072F, 074D..074F, and the
    characters from the Syriac Supplement block (0860..086F). Will you
    add them?</em></h3>
    <p>This font supports the East Syriac style of writing. No examples
    of those characters are provided in the East Syriac style.</p>
