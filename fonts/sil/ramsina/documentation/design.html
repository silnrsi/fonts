    <p>Ramsina is a font family for the East Syriac script. The font was
    designed as a revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in India from
    around 1920. This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and
    named East Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of
    the <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font
    License</a>. The Latin letters are a subset of the <a
    href="https://github.com/Fonthausen/CrimsonPro">Crimson Pro</a>
    font.</p>
    <p>One font from this typeface family is included in the
    <em>Ramsina</em> release:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ramsina Regular</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="alaph-shape">Alaph shape</h2>
    <p>The shape of U+0710 SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH varies, depending on
    context, the character that precedes it, and whether it has a
    diacritic or not. These are conventions, and there is no documented
    hard rules of how the shape is rendered. This font follows the
    <em>Khudra</em> (the most widely used Syriac book in the church)
    convention.</p>

    or 072A SYRIAC LETTER RISH followed by 0710 SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH
    Obligatory: 0710 is rendered as Glyph 1</li>
    <li>0720 SYRIAC LETTER LAMADH followed by 0710 SYRIAC LETTER ALAPH
    and they end the word, then 0710 is rendered as Glyph 3. It can be a
    ligature with connecting and non-connecting form and be used
    universally. Glyph 3 is only used with 0720</li>
    <li>All other contexts of 0710, follow the general rule of shaping,
    i.e. initial, middle, and end forms.</li>
