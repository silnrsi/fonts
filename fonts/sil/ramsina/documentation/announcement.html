    <p>We are very pleased to announce the release of <em>Ramsina</em>,
    a new font for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The font
    was designed as a close revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in
    India from around 1920.</p>
    <p>The font name, <em>Ramsina</em>, is a pure Assyrian name for
    females adored by many. The emphasis is on the second syllable:
    rahm-SEE-nah.</p>
    <p>This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East
    Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the <a
    href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font License</a>.</p>
    <p>Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single,
    all-platforms package on the <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/font-ramsina/releases">Download
    page</a>.</p>
