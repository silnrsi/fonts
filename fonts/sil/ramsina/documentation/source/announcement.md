fontversion: 2.000
---

We are very pleased to announce the release of _Ramsina_, a new font for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The font was designed as a close revival, or facsimile, of metal type cut in India from around 1920.

The font name, _Ramsina_, is a pure Assyrian name for females adored by many. The emphasis is on the second syllable: rahm-SEE-nah.

This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/).

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download page](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-ramsina/releases).
