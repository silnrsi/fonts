    </header>
    <h2 id="new-major-release">New major release</h2>
    <p>Andika version 7 is a major release with many new additions,
    enhancements, and improvements. This is a summary of the most
    notable changes and what you need to know if you have been using
    earlier versions. <strong>Please read this carefully to understand
    the major changes.</strong> For further details on these changes,
    particularly regarding individual characters, see <a
    href="history.html">Version History</a>.</p>
    <p>The changes in this version could have a significant effect on
    line, paragraph, and page lengths due to added kerning. Because of
    this we have released a font that reproduces the exact metrics and
    behavior of Andika v6.200—<em>Andika Six</em>—that can be installed
    at the same time as the newest Andika (v7 and beyond). Andika v7 is
    still the best font for most people to use. But if you have
    documents prepared with Andika v6.200 and need to preserve the
    spacing, you can install Andika Six, change the doc to use it
    instead of Andika, and avoid any issues with reflow. Then you can
    use Andika v7 for new documents and benefit from the many
    improvements in this and future versions. See the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/andika-six-release-6-210-a-renamed-version-of-andika-6-200/">Andika
    Six announcement</a> for more details on downloading and using
    Andika Six.</p>
    <h2 id="family-structure">Family structure</h2>
    <h3 id="additional-intermediate-weights">Additional intermediate
    weights</h3>
    <p>Andika now has additional intermediate weights. Previously
    existing weights have not changed. The CSS values for the weights
    within each family are in parentheses. Italic faces follow a similar
    structure and correspondence.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/weights.png" class="fullsize"
    alt="New v7 weights" />
    <!-- PRODUCT SITE IMAGE SRC https://software.sil.org/andika/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/05/weights.png --></p>
    <p>The new intermediate weights in this extended, axis-based family
    can be confusing for applications that still assume families should
    have only four members (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic). This is
    the case for Microsoft Word and some older Windows applications. For
    details on how to use the intermediate weights in these
    applications, see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Using
    Axis-Based Font Families</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="no-compact-versions">No Compact versions</h3>
    <p>The v7 fonts do not have <em>Compact</em> variants. If you need
    compact line spacing, and your application does not allow explicit
    line spacing control, you can continue to use the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2 Andika
    Compact fonts</a>, which remain available. <strong>If you need any
    of the new v7 features or characters, but also need them supported
    in a compact version please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>. We continue to recommend that you set line spacing
    explicitly in your document styles and preferences, and adjust it as
    needed for your particular situation.</strong></p>
    <p>TypeTuner Web no longer offers line spacing alternatives for the
    v7 fonts (Normal, Tight, Loose). If you need Tight or Loose variants
    the v6.2 fonts remain available and support line spacing
    alternatives.</p>
    <h3
    id="special-purpose-modified-variants-have-not-been-updated-to-v7">Special-purpose
    modified variants have not been updated to v7</h3>
    <p>In previous versions, special-purpose modified font variants were
    available that had been ‘pre-tuned’ to turn on certain features by
    default for some regional and special uses. These are not available
    for the v7 fonts, however, the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2
    special-purpose fonts are still available</a>. <strong>If you need
    any of the new features or characters in this version, but also need
    them supported in the special-purpose modified fonts please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>Note that even in version 7, features such as character variants
    can be manually preset with <a
    href="https://typetunerweb.languagetechnology.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi">TypeTuner
    Web</a>. The only change to this is that the 'pre-tuned' versions
    remain at version 6.2.</p>
    <h2 id="new-features-and-character-support">New features and
    character support</h2>
    <h3 id="new-kerning">New kerning</h3>
    <p>Kerning has now been added to cover the full range of alphabetic
    symbols except for small caps (which will be included in a future
    update). To make this practically useful for a wide range of
    languages, the letters have been clustered into overly generalized
    groups. This enables the kerning to apply to more combinations, but
    does not allow for careful fine-tuning. The generalized kerning may
    not be ideal in all cases, and may still require manual adjustment,
    but it should provide improved spacing compared with previous
    versions. It is very possible that we have made some mistakes in
    this massive kerning effort, so please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/andika/about/contact/">contact us</a>
    if you encounter any combinations whose spacing has been made worse
    than in v6.2.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning: Because of the addition of extensive kerning,
    line, paragraph, and page lengths may be different from
    v6.2.</strong></p>

    <h3
    id="capital-n-left-hook-default-changed-to-lowercase-style">Capital
    N Left Hook default changed to lowercase style</h3>
    <p>The default form for capital N with left hook has been changed to
    the lowercase style to match the capital Eng. The related feature
    (<code>cv44</code>) has been changed to substitute the uppercase
    style form. See the <a href="features.html">Feature list</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="diagonal-6-9-feature-split-into-two">Diagonal 6 &amp; 9
    feature split into two</h3>
    <p>The OpenType feature for alternate versions of 6 and 9 with
    diagonal stems has been split into two separate features. The
    previously existing feature (<code>cv06</code>) now only affects the
    numeral 6. A new feature (<code>cv09</code>) affects only the
    numeral 9. See the <a href="features.html">Feature list</a>.</p>
    <h3
    id="additional-character-support-including-unicode-16">Additional
    character support including Unicode 16</h3>
    <p>Support has been added for 29 additional characters, some of
    which were introduced in Unicode 16. For a full list see <a
    href="history.html">Version History</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="general-improvements">General improvements</h2>
    <p>Other improvements have been made to over 150 glyphs, OpenType
    code, and other font aspects, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Letters with upper-right hooks have been redesigned to improve
    spacing (including kerning) and reduce collisions. Some collisions
    have been retained to reduce unwanted whitespace within words (e.g.
    ƴk).</li>
    <li>Central European carons have improved designs and kerning.</li>
    <li>Bridging diacritics handle many more possible combinations. See
    <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/bridging-diacritics/">Using
    Bridging Diacritics</a> for details on how these need to be encoded
    and ordered.</li>
    <li>The small caps feature now affects parentheses and
    brackets.</li>
    <li>Autohinting is more consistent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details see <a href="history.html">Version
    History</a>.</p>

    suggestions on how we can make the fonts better, please <a
