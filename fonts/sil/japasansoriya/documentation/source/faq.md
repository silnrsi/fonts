Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Japa Sans Oriya:

#### *Will you add script support for another Indic script such as Telugu?*

We have no plans to do that. If a language uses both the Oriya/Odia script and another script, we recommend using another font for that script.

#### *How is this font different than Noto Sans Oriya*

Japa Sans Oriya was designed specifically for the Kuvi and Kui languages. These two languages needed support for an overline character. Additionally, the Kui language requires support for the dot above and double dot above character which are not yet in Unicode. The dot above is currently supported through the U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE codepoint, and the double dot above is supported by the U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS codepoint. Once those characters are officially in Unicode, this font will be modified to support the official Oriya-specific codepoints. Kui also requires an alternate form of U+0B35 ORIYA LETTER VA. There is a character variant (cv10) which supports this alternate.
