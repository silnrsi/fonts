title: Japa Sans Oriya - Announcement
fontversion: 2.300
---

The Japa Sans Oriya family of fonts supports the broad variety of writing systems that use the Oriya script.

### Changes

- Add _nadana_ conjunct
- Position dot over eMatra on conjuncts as well as consonants
- Improve combining mark ligatures
- Removed
  - U+0242 LATIN SMALL LETTER GLOTTAL STOP
  - U+A78C LATIN SMALL LETTER SALTILLO

### Known Issues

The Kui language requires support for the dot above and double dot above character which are not yet in Unicode. The dot above is currently supported through the U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE codepoint, and the double dot above is supported by the U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS codepoint. Once those characters are officially in Unicode, this font will be modified to support the official Oriya-specific codepoints. 

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download page](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-japa-sans-oriya/releases).
