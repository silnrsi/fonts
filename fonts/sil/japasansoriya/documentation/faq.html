    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Japa Sans Oriya:</p>
    <h4
    id="will-you-add-script-support-for-another-indic-script-such-as-telugu"><em>Will
    you add script support for another Indic script such as
    Telugu?</em></h4>
    <p>We have no plans to do that. If a language uses both the
    Oriya/Odia script and another script, we recommend using another
    font for that script.</p>
    <h4 id="how-is-this-font-different-than-noto-sans-oriya"><em>How is
    this font different than Noto Sans Oriya</em></h4>
    <p>Japa Sans Oriya was designed specifically for the Kuvi and Kui
    languages. These two languages needed support for an overline
    character. Additionally, the Kui language requires support for the
    dot above and double dot above character which are not yet in
    Unicode. The dot above is currently supported through the U+0307
    COMBINING DOT ABOVE codepoint, and the double dot above is supported
    by the U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS codepoint. Once those characters
    are officially in Unicode, this font will be modified to support the
    official Oriya-specific codepoints. Kui also requires an alternate
    form of U+0B35 ORIYA LETTER VA. There is a character variant (cv10)
    which supports this alternate.</p>
