Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding BJCree:

#### *How is this font different than BJCree UNI?*

**BJCree UNI** is a shareware font. The Latin typeface in the **BJCree UNI** font included Latin designed glyphs which were specifically licensed to the original designer of the Canadian syllabics, Bill Jancewicz. That license did not permit reusing the Latin glyphs when transferring this project to SIL. Thus, this current **BJCree** font has been developed using a completely new Latin typeface in a style very similar to the previous Latin design. Additionally, the syllabic glyphs, while based on the proportions and metrics of the original **BJCree UNI** design, have been reviewed and standardized to facilitate easier maintenance in the future.

#### *What does "BJ" mean in the font name?*

"BJ" represents the *Baie-James* (James Bay) region of Canada where the Cree and Naskapi language communities are located. Its design is based on the preferred style of Canadian Syllabics used by speakers in that region.
