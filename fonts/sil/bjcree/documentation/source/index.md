Thank you for your interest in the BJCree fonts. The BJCree typeface was originally designed in conjunction with the Naskapi
community in the 1990s. When it was subsequently re-encoded for Unicode,
coverage was extended for all the Cree (and Ojibwa) languages. 

This documentation is a set of HTML pages that can be viewed in any modern web browser. PDF versions of these pages are also provided. This content, plus download links and a contact form, are available from the [BJCree site](https://software.sil.org/bjcree/).
