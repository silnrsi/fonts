    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding BJCree:</p>
    <h4 id="how-is-this-font-different-than-bjcree-uni"><em>How is this
    font different than BJCree UNI?</em></h4>
    <p><strong>BJCree UNI</strong> is a shareware font. The Latin
    typeface in the <strong>BJCree UNI</strong> font included Latin
    designed glyphs which were specifically licensed to the original
    designer of the Canadian syllabics, Bill Jancewicz. That license did
    not permit reusing the Latin glyphs when transferring this project
    to SIL. Thus, this current <strong>BJCree</strong> font has been
    developed using a completely new Latin typeface in a style very
    similar to the previous Latin design. Additionally, the syllabic
    glyphs, while based on the proportions and metrics of the original
    <strong>BJCree UNI</strong> design, have been reviewed and
    standardized to facilitate easier maintenance in the future.</p>
    <h4 id="what-does-bj-mean-in-the-font-name"><em>What does "BJ" mean
    in the font name?</em></h4>
    <p>"BJ" represents the <em>Baie-James</em> (James Bay) region of
    Canada where the Cree and Naskapi language communities are located.
    Its design is based on the preferred style of Canadian Syllabics
    used by speakers in that region.</p>
