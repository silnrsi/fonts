    </header>
    <p>The BJCree font supports most of the characters in the Unified
    Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics blocks. In particular, it was
    originally designed to accommodate all the languages that use
    syllabics that are part of the Cree-Innu subgroup of the Algonquian
    language family. Notably absent in this release is support for
    languages that use syllabics from other language families spoken in
    Canada: that is Athabaskan (Carrier, Dene) and Eskimo-Aleut
    (Inuktitut).</p>
