    <p>The <strong>BJCree</strong> font is a Canadian Syllabics font in
    the style preferred by Cree and Naskapi communities of Canada. It
    was originally designed in collaboration with the persons who speak
    these languages around James Bay.</p>
    <p>The glyph shapes and metrics were designed for these languages
    intending to strike a balance between the local usage and
    preferences of literate speakers and the syllabic character shapes
    found in traditional Cree religious literature and hymnbooks,
    especially publications and translations by Bishop John Horden, and
    Rev. William Walton. These works, originally published by the
    Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and the
    British and Foreign Bible Society in Great Britain, were widely
    distributed in the regions around James Bay and still in common use
    by Cree and Naskapi speakers in the 1990s when the digital font was
    being developed.</p>
    <p>BJCree’s design is intended to be highly readable, consistent,
    and visually familiar. One design strategy for greater readability
    is to provide much more generous white space between words than in
    many other Canadian Syllabic fonts. Also, a consistent stroke width
    and curve radius for the rounded characters that echoed the familiar
    design of the fonts used in legacy religious literature made the
    font broadly acceptable and widely used in literacy and
    education.</p>
    <p>Four fonts from this typeface family are included in the
    <strong>BJCree</strong> release:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>BJCree Regular</li>
    <li>BJCree Medium</li>
    <li>BJCree SemiBold</li>
    <li>BJCree Bold</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Latin glyphs are based on C059 (New Century Schoolbook) from
    (URW)++, released under the SIL Open Font License version 1.1.</p>
