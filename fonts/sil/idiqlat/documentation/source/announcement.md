title: Idiqlat - Announcement
fontversion: 2.000
---

We are very pleased to announce the release of _Idiqlat_, a new font for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. The East Syriac style is used primarily by the Assyrians (Church of the East) and Chaldeans. It is also used by the Syrian Orthodox in headings of texts. 

Although initially designed by Esho Marcus, significant design changes have been made in order to modernize and optimize the font for web and mobile use. Additionally, the font has been resized in order to match standard point sizes in modern fonts. It also includes other weights:

- Idiqlat ExtraLight
- Idiqlat Light
- Idiqlat Regular

The font name, _Idiqlat_, means “Tigris River” in ancient Akkadian/Assyrian. The emphasis is on the first syllable: EE-dee-klat.

The font supports the complete range of Unicode characters required for the East Syriac style of the Syriac script. 

This font was initially designed by Esho Marcus and named East Syriac Marcus. The font is used according to the terms of the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/).

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download page](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-idiqlat/releases).
