    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-kanchenjunga-come-from"><em>Where does
    the name Kanchenjunga come from?</em></h4>
    <p>Kanchenjunga is the world’s third highest mountain, situated on
    the border between Sikkim state in northeast India and eastern
    Nepal. Etymology of this name is found in Britannica: The name
    Kanchenjunga is derived from four words of Tibetan origin, usually
    rendered Kang-chen-dzo-nga or Yang-chhen-dzö-nga and interpreted in
    Sikkim as the “Five Treasuries of the Great Snow.” This peak
    represents the geographical distribution of the Bantawa language
    quite well.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-is-this-font-different-from-v1.000-which-was-released-before-it-was-officially-in-the-unicode-standard"><em>How
    is this font different from v1.000 which was released before it was
    officially in the Unicode Standard?</em></h4>
    <p>The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode
    Standard version 16.0. Kanchenjunga version 1.000 was released in
    2023 with provisional codepoints. However, those codepoints did not
    change, so if you used Kanchenjunga version 1.000, no data
    conversion will be necessary. The only difference is that the font
    now includes a Medium and SemiBold weight in addition to the Regular
    and Bold that were released with version 1.000.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-would-like-to-use-the-variants-defined-in-character-variants.-how-do-i-type-these-using-the-kanchenjunga-font-how-do-i-use-these-variants"><em>I
    would like to use the variants defined in Character Variants. How do
    I type these using the Kanchenjunga font? How do I use these
    variants?</em></h4>
    <p>Type the character the same way you would type its standard form
    (see "Keyboarding and character set support" in <a
    href="resources.html">Resources</a> for a keyboard). Then select the
    variants to be displayed. If your application supports the OpenType
    Character Variant features, you can use these to access the font
    features built into the font. See <a href="features.html">Font
    Features</a> page for more details.</p>
    <p>If your application does not support the OpenType Character
    Variants, you can use TypeTunerWeb to customize the font with the
    variants you require. See <a href="features.html">Font Features</a>
    page for more details.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-used-a-kirat-rai-font-which-was-custom-encoded.-how-can-i-convert-my-data-from-the-custom-encoding-to-unicode"><em>I
    used a Kirat Rai font which was custom encoded. How can I convert my
    data from the custom encoding to Unicode?</em></h4>
    <p>Data which was created with the a custom encoded font will not be
    automatically converted to Unicode by switching fonts. The data must
    be converted to Unicode using a data conversion routine. See "Text
    conversion" in <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> for
    information on converting your data.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-have-text-in-bantawa-using-the-devanagari-script.-how-can-i-convert-my-data-from-devanagari-to-kirat-rai"><em>I
    have text in Bantawa using the Devanagari script. How can I convert
    my data from Devanagari to Kirat Rai?</em></h4>
    <p>A TECKit converter to convert text from Devanagari script to
    Kirat Rai is available. See "Text conversion" in <a
    href="resources.html">Resources</a> for information on converting
    your data.</p>
