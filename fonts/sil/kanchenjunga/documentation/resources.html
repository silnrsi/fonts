    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>This font is supported by all major desktop operating systems
    (macOS, Windows, and Linux-based). However, it will have limited
    support on mobile devices such as iOS and Android. The extent of
    that support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the font by decompressing the .zip archive and installing
    the font using the standard font installation process for .ttf
    (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see
    the help page on <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font
    installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and
    character set support</h2>
    <p>This font does not include keyboards or other software for
    entering text. To type the symbols in this font, use the keyboarding
    systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility. <a
    href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> is a cross-platform
    keyboarding system and one Kirat Rai keyboard is available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/kirat_rai_inscript">Kirat
    Rai Inscript</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Various other means may be available for different
    operating-system platforms to create additional input methods. Some
    suggestions are listed here: <a
    href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems
    Overview</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details
    of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application
    support</h2>
    <p>The Kirat Rai script, and this font, does not require any special
    rendering. However, there are a few OpenType character variants in
    the font, and selecting a character variant will require an
    application that supports that selection. The font also includes
    some kerning.</p>

    Features</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of this font (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are
    available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a
    web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS
    demo page is also included. For more information on the options and
    techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion"><a id="conv"></a>Text conversion</h2>
    <p>Since this script was only encoded in 2024, people may wish to
    convert documents from custom-encoded fonts to the provisional
    Unicode codepoints. TECkit is one program that can be used for
    character encoding conversion. TECkit allows users to write their
    own custom conversion mappings. The TECkit package is available for
    download from SIL’s <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> Web site. The <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL Converters</a>
    software will be an important tool in data conversion.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a
    href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to
    Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
    <p>Two TECKit mapping files are currently available. Both of them
    should still be considered experimental. Feedback through the Github
    repository is welcomed.</p>
