    </header>
    <p>This font is encoded based on <em>provisional</em> Unicode codepoints assigned to the Kirat Rai script. At this point it is not in Unicode.</p>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>This font is supported by all major desktop operating systems (macOS, Windows, and Linux-based). However, it will have limited support on mobile devices such as iOS and Android. The extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the font by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the font using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see the help page on <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and character set support</h2>
    <p>This font package does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. If you cannot use the built-in keyboards of the operating system, you will need to install the appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system keyboard, the <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman program</a> can be helpful on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS systems. Also available for Windows is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134">MSKLC</a>. For other platforms, <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/XKB/">XKB</a> or <a href="https://software.sil.org/ukelele/">Ukelele</a> can be helpful.</p>
    <p>If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system keyboard, and to access the full Unicode range, we suggest you use gucharmap, kcharselect on Ubuntu or similar software. Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications such as Adobe InDesign. They can display a glyph palette that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter them by clicking on the glyph you want.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems Overview</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application support</h2>
    <p>This Kirat Rai script, and this font, does not require any special rendering. However, there are a few OpenType character variants in the font, and selecting a character variant will require an application that supports that selection. The font also includes some kerning.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a href="https://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/support/application-support/">Applications Support</a> and here: <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/features/">Using Font Features</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of this font (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS demo page is also included. For more information on the options and techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>Since this script is provisionally encoded, people may wish to convert documents from custom-encoded fonts to the provisional Unicode codepoints. TECkit is one program that can be used for character encoding conversion. TECkit allows users to write their own custom conversion mappings. The TECkit package is available for download from SIL’s <a href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> Web site. The <a href="https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL Converters</a> software will be an important tool in data conversion.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
    <p>Two TECKit mapping files are currently available. Both of them should still be considered experimental. Feedback through the Github repository is welcomed.</p>
