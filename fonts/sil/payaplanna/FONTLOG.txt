Payap Lanna
===========

This file provides detailed information on the Payap Lanna Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Payap Lanna and any derivative works.

## About this project

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all current languages and writing systems that use Tai Tham script of Northern Thailand. This font supports the Tai Tham script plus a range of useful Latin characters.

The design is inspired by, but not based on, the CR Udom fonts designed by Charin Jamjitt. It has been produced with help from [Payap's Linguistics Institute](http://li.payap.ac.th).

## ChangeLog

### 25 August 2022 (SIL WSTech Team) Payap Lanna version 1.000

First official release.

## Information for developers and contributors

We welcome other developers who wish to get involved in supporting and enhancing these fonts or who want to modify them.

SIL’s fonts are licensed according to the terms of the SIL Open Font License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL). The OFL allows the fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. For details see the OFL.txt and OFL-FAQ.txt files in the package.

Full sources are included in this package. For information on the source formats or how the fonts are built see documentation/developer.html.
