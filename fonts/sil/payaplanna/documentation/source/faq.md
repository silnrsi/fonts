Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions specifically regarding Payap Lanna:

#### *Why does this font only support Graphite?*

The current OpenType and shaping engine support for Tai Tham (Lanna) does not correctly handle some sequences, and there is no workaround. Graphite provides proper rendering for those sequences, but requires an application that supports Graphite.

#### *Will you support OpenType in the future?*

Yes, we expect to fully support OpenType once changes to the shaping engines make that possible.
