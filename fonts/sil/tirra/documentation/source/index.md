Thank you for your interest in the Tirra fonts. This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for writing systems that use the Neo-Tifinagh alphabet. It includes a set of common Neo-Tifinagh ligatures that combine certain base characters with the Labialization Mark. For completeness, it contains all of the Unicode characters for the Tifinagh script. It also has a basic set of Latin characters. 

This documentation is a set of HTML pages that can be viewed in any modern web browser. PDF versions of these pages are also provided. This content, plus download links and a contact form, are available from the [Tirra web page](https://software.sil.org/tirra/).
