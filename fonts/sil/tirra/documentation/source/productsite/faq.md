#### *How do I access the full range of weights?*
The full range of weights is accessed in different ways depending on the application. See [Using Axis-Based Font Families](https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/) for details.

#### *Why do some features not work in Microsoft Word?*
<p>Ligature formation may not automatically work in Word 2016 or earlier. To enable ligatures, go to <strong>Format / Font / Advanced / OpenType features</strong> and change *None* to one of the other settings. It may also be necessary to choose <strong>Use Contextual Alternates</strong>. For an alternative to Word, we recommend [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/).</p>

#### *Why do some features not work in Adobe InDesign?*
<p>To enable the complex features in InDesign, select the text, then change the <strong>Paragraph</strong> setting (<strong>Typography</strong> palette, <strong>Paragraph</strong> section) to <strong>Adobe World-Ready Paragraph Composer</strong>. It may also help to set the language to <strong>\[No Language]</strong>.</p>
