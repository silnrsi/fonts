README
Nokyung
=======

Nokyung is an open font for the New Tai Lue script, providing Regular and
Bold weights. In addition to TrueType fonts (.ttf), this package contains
WOFF files for use in designing web pages (see the web folder).

At the moment the project is still undergoing significant changes.
**Be aware that font metrics may change in future versions and cause
document reflow.**

Install the fonts using your normal operating system procedures. This package
does not contain a keyboard for the New Tai Lue script. Your operating system
may provide a way to type in the script, but you may find the Keyman program
helpful (https://keyman.com/). A Tai Lue keyboard is available, but has not
been tested with the current font (http://keymankeyboards.com/?q=tai+lue).

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a commercial
level of personal technical support. If you do find a problem, please do report
it through http://scripts.sil.org/support. We can't guarantee any direct response,
but will try to fix reported bugs in future versions.
