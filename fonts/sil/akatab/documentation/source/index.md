Thank you for your interest in the Akatab fonts. This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for current languages and writing systems that use the Tifinagh script. It supports all of the Unicode characters for this script. It also includes a large set of ligatures useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font routines automatically produce these ligatures. In addition, user-selectable features are included to choose variant characters or ligatures. 

This documentation is a set of HTML pages that can be viewed in any modern web browser. PDF versions of these pages are also provided. This content, plus download links and a contact form, are available from the [Akatab web page](https://software.sil.org/akatab/).
