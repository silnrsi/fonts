    <h4 id="how-do-i-access-the-full-range-of-weights"><em>How do I access the full range of weights?</em></h4>
    <p>The full range of weights is accessed in different ways depending on the application. See <a href="">Using Axis-Based Font Families</a> for details.</p>
    <h4 id="how-do-i-access-the-character-variants-and-stylistic-sets-features"><em>How do I access the Character Variants and Stylistic Sets features?</em></h4>
    <p>Help with application support for font features can be found here: <a href="">Using Font Features</a>. Issues specific to popular applications are below.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-some-features-not-work-in-microsoft-word"><em>Why do some features not work in Microsoft Word?</em></h4>
    <p>
    Ligature formation may not automatically work in Word 2016 or earlier. To enable ligatures, go to <strong>Format / Font / Advanced / OpenType features</strong> and change <em>None</em> to one of the other settings. It may also be necessary to choose <strong>Use Contextual Alternates</strong>. You can also select <strong>Stylistic Sets</strong> and other features here. Unfortunately, right to left characters do not render properly in Word. For right to left behaviour in a word processor, we recommend <a href="">LibreOffice</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="why-do-some-features-not-work-in-adobe-indesign"><em>Why do some features not work in Adobe InDesign?</em></h4>
    <p>
    To enable the complex features in InDesign, select the text, then change the <strong>Paragraph</strong> setting (<strong>Typography</strong> palette, <strong>Paragraph</strong> section) to <strong>Adobe World-Ready Paragraph Composer</strong>. It may also help to set the language to <strong>[No Language]</strong>.
