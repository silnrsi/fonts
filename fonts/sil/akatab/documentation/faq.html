    access the full range of weights?</em></h4>

    features?</em></h4>

    some features not work in Microsoft Word?</em></h4>
    <p>
    Ligature formation may not automatically work in Word 2016 or
    earlier. To enable ligatures, go to <strong>Format / Font / Advanced
    / OpenType features</strong> and change <em>None</em> to one of the
    other settings. It may also be necessary to choose <strong>Use
    Contextual Alternates</strong>. You can also select
    <strong>Stylistic Sets</strong> and other features here.
    Unfortunately, right to left characters do not render properly in
    Word. For right to left behaviour in a word processor, we recommend

    <h4 id="why-do-some-features-not-work-in-adobe-indesign"><em>Why do
    some features not work in Adobe InDesign?</em></h4>
    <p>
    To enable the complex features in InDesign, select the text, then
    change the <strong>Paragraph</strong> setting
    (<strong>Typography</strong> palette, <strong>Paragraph</strong>
    section) to <strong>Adobe World-Ready Paragraph Composer</strong>.
    It may also help to set the language to <strong>[No
    Language]</strong>.
