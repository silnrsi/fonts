    <h2 id="about-this-project">About this project</h2>
    <p>Kay Pho Du is a font for the Kayah Li script, based initially on the design of <a href="">Karenni</a>, although the glyphs have been redrawn and a new Latin set has been added. There are four weights: Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold. It supports the full Kayah Li range of Unicode characters (U+A900..U+A92F).</p>
