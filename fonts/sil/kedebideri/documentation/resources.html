    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>These fonts are supported by all major operating systems (macOS,
    Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that
    support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and
    installing the fonts using the standard font installation process
    for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional
    tips see the help page on <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font
    installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and
    character set support</h2>
    <p>This font package does not include keyboards or other software
    for entering text. To type the symbols in this font, use the
    keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility.
    <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> is a cross-platform
    keyboarding system and one Beria Erfe keyboard is available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/beria_erfe_phonetic">Beria
    Erfe Phonetic</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Various other means may be available for different
    operating-system platforms to create additional input methods. Some
    suggestions are listed here: <a
    href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems
    Overview</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details
    of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application
    support</h2>
    <p>These fonts will work normally like any other fonts in most
    applications. Since the writing system requires special diacritic
    positioning and kerning, the application/OS will need to support
    OpenType.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of these fonts (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are
    available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a
    web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS
    demo page is also included. For more information on the options and
    techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>Since this script was only recently encoded, people may wish to
    convert documents from custom encoded fonts to the official Unicode
    codepoints. TECkit is one program that can be used for character
    encoding conversion. TECkit allows users to write their own custom
    conversion mappings. The TECkit package is available for download
    from SIL’s <a href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> Web
    site. The <a href="https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL
    Converters</a> software will be an important tool in data
    conversion.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a
    href="https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to
    Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
    <p>There is a minimally tested TECKit mapping file available for
    converting data from the custom encoded Zaghawa Beria font to the
    Unicode codepoints:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a

    </ul>
