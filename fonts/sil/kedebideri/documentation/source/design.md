title: Kedebideri - Design
fontversion: 3.001
---

The Kedebideri font supports the Beria Erfe script which is used for the Zaghawa Beria language of Sudan and Chad.

This font was initially designed by a volunteer who chooses to remain anonymous, in cooperation with SIL Global and the Mission Protestante Franco-Suisse au Tchad.

The Latin glyphs were imported from Source Sans Pro at 103% and a weight of CSS 360 for Regular and CSS 670 for Black.

Six weights for this typeface family are included:

* Kedebideri Regular
* Kedebideri Medium
* Kedebideri SemiBold
* Kedebideri Bold
* Kedebideri ExtraBold
* Kedebideri Black
