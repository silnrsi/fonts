## Private-use (PUA) characters

There is a small number of private-use characters that are supported in this font. These conform to [SIL Global’s corporate registry](https://github.com/silnrsi/unicode-resources/tree/main/sil-pua) for usage of the Unicode private-use areas. Characters which are not yet in Unicode are shown below. 

### Khmer Ornaments

These are intended to be used as paragraph separators. They are not part of Unicode and there is no expectation that they will ever be included in the standard. Other fonts will not display them properly.
