    <h4 id="where-does-the-name-busra-come-from">Where does the name
    Busra come from?</h4>
    <p>A popular tourist attraction, the Bou Sra waterfall is located in
    Bousra Eco Park in Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia. The name is also
    spelled Bu Sra, Bousra or Busra. It is famous for its triple-tier
    cascade.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-is-this-font-different-from-the-khmer-busra-font-available-as-part-of-the-older-mondulkiri-font-package">How
    is this font different from the Khmer Busra font available as part
    of the older Mondulkiri font package?</h4>
    <p>There are significant differences between this Busra font and the
    previous version (7.100). A few of these are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The name of the font has changed from “Khmer Busra” to “Busra”.
    This allows both versions of the font to be installed
    simultaneously.</li>
    <li>The font supports a new Khmer encoding structure; see <a
    href="https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn61">UTN #61: Khmer Encoding
    Structure</a>.</li>
    <li>There is no longer support for Graphite or Apple's AAT
    technology.</li>
    <li>The Latin has been completely redesigned.</li>
    <li>Oblique (italic) weights are not included. These will be
    provided in a later version.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="problems-with-bold-weights">Problems with Bold weights</h3>
    <h4
    id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs"><em>Why
    does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and
    dialogs?</em></h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold.
    To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using
    the application's UI controls such as a "B" button. See our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font Help
    Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold"><em>Why do I sometimes
    get a fake Bold?</em></h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as ExtraLight),
    and then use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications
    will make a "fake" Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the
    font (Medium, SemiBold, Bold). This is because only Regular has an
    associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with
    some apps and OSes. If you are using a weight other than Regular for
    text and want to make a word or phrase stand out, you will need to
    select the text and apply one of the heavier weights manually. See
    our <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Font
    Help Guide on Axis-Based Font Families</a> for more information.</p>
