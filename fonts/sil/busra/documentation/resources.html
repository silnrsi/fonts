    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>This font is supported by all major desktop operating systems
    (macOS, Windows, and Linux-based). However, it will have limited
    support on mobile devices such as iOS and Android. The extent of
    that support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the font by decompressing the .zip archive and installing
    the font using the standard font installation process for .ttf
    (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see
    the help page on <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font
    installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and
    character set support</h2>
    <p>This font package does not include keyboards or other software
    for entering text. To type the symbols in this font, use the
    keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility.
    <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> is a cross-platform
    keyboarding system; here are Khmer keyboards that are available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/khmer_angkor">Khmer
    Angkor Keyboard</a></p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_khmer">Khmer SIL
    Keyboard</a></p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character set support</a> for details
    of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application
    support</h2>
    <p>These fonts will work normally like any other fonts in most
    applications. The application/OS will need to support OpenType in
    order to handle the many complexities of Khmer script.</p>
    <p>These fonts also include OpenType features for variant forms and
    alternate character positioning. For information on the specific
    features available in these fonts see <a href="features.html">Font
    features</a>.</p>
    <p>If special font features are to be activated the application will
    need to provide a way to turn on the feature or choose the feature
    setting. Details of current application support, and specific
    techniques for activating features, are on the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/features">Using Font
    Features</a> help page.</p>
    <p>Although the current font supports only OpenType, previous
    versions provided support for Graphite and AAT (Apple Advanced
    Typography) technologies. These older versions remain available from
    the <a href="https://software.sil.org/mondulkiri">Mondulkiri package
    webpage</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of this font (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are
    available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a
    web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS
    demo page is also included. For more information on the options and
    techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages</a>.</p>
