    </header>
    <p>Busra is based on an earlier font that is part of a larger
    package of Khmer script fonts called Mondulkiri. Earlier forms of
    Busra were called “Khmer Mondulkiri book” and “Khmer Busra”.
    Significant changes exist between the earlier versions and this
    Busra release:</p>

    <h3 id="february-2025-sil-wstech-team-busra-version-9.000">7
    February 2025 (SIL WSTech Team) Busra version 9.000</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The font family is now called "Busra" so it and the old "Khmer
    Busra" can be installed at the same time.</li>
    <li>There are six weights: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium,
    SemiBold, and Bold. This also replaces the older Khmer Mondulkiri
    family.</li>
    <li>Oblique (italic) styles are not included but will be provided in
    a later release.</li>
    <li>Glyph outlines have been revised and improved.</li>
    <li>OpenType support has been rewritten, supporting latest best
    practice in Khmer text encoding; see <a
    href="https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn61">UTN #61: Khmer Encoding
    Structure</a>.</li>
    <li>Support for Graphite and AAT rendering has been removed.</li>
    <li>Latin glyphs have been replaced with ones specifically designed
    to work well with the Khmer glyphs.</li>
    <li>Default line spacing has updated to best practice. This could
    affect older Windows apps.</li>
    <li>Three font formats are provided: OpenType (.ttf) for desktop use
    and WOFF/WOFF2 for the web.</li>
    </ul>

    September 2014 (Diethelm Kanjahn) Mondulkiri Font Family version
    7.100</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Mondulkiri changes:
    <ul>
    <li>The hinting has been improved, the difference between regular
    and bold is visible on screen in much smaller font sizes than
    before.</li>
    <li>A few bugs were addressed: the disappearing of glyphs on Mac in
    certain strings that do not occur in correctly typed text, a
    positioning problem in some Tampuan words on Mac, one syllable in
    Bunong text on Windows/Linux.</li>
    <li>Minor changes in diacritic placement, mostly on Mac. Coeng Kho
    and coeng Ttha were modified.</li>
    <li>Glyphs were added - mostly in the phonetic symbols section. The
    shaping tables for Mac were streamlined and are now the same as for
    the Busra font.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Busra changes:
    <ul>
    <li>The fonts now have AAT tables so that they work on Mac OS X</li>
    <li>many glyphs were added, the glyph range is the same as in
    Mondulkiri 7.100</li>
    <li>many glyph shapes and diacritic placements were improved
    slightly</li>
    <li>the ligatures of some consonants with the 'sra-a', 'sra-oo' and
    'sra-ou' have changed and are now the same as in Mondulkiri.</li>
    <li>hinting has been improved</li>
    <li>most other changes from Mondulkiri 5.300 to 5.513 are now also
    in Busra 7.100</li>
    <li>The descender value was changed which may affect line
    spacing.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>

    October 2012 (Diethelm Kanjahn) Mondulkiri Font Family version
    5.300</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Split Khmer Mondulkiri fonts from older fonts release</li>
    <li>Support for Apple's AAT rendering system (tested in OS X 10.6.8)
    as well as Microsoft OpenType tables.</li>
    <li>Support for typographical features to be used under OS X with
    software that does support them (like Pages or TextEdit, but
    apparently not MS Word or LibreOffice).</li>
    <li>Support for 'Stylistic Sets' that provide similar options in
    OpenType as the 'typographical features' in OS X. These Stylistic
    Sets work in Adobe software (tested with CS5 and 5.5 on PC), but not
    in MS Word. MS Word 2010 does support Stylistic Sets, but apparently
    only for Latin scripts.</li>
    <li>Support for Khmer Unicode in Adobe CS5 and CS5.5. Two of the
    Stylistic Sets address the remaining problems. Please refer to the
    documentation on stylistic sets.</li>
    <li>Many Latin script characters have been added. The bold fonts now
    have also bold Latin characters.</li>
    <li>Some of the vowel-a ligatures have been changed (e.g.
    Cho-AA).</li>
    <li>Many characters have been slightly modified. Most significantly
    the 'hooks' or 'hair' of some coengs have been removed (e.g.
    coeng-Kho, coeng-Ha, coeng-Qa).</li>
    <li>The positioning of many characters was modified.</li>
    <li>Many other smaller modifications of glyphs and rules.</li>
    <li>To prevent register shifters from being rendered as subscript
    zero-width-non-joiner has now to be inserted before the register
    shifter in accordance with The Unicode Standard. Also
    zero-width-joiner has to be in this position now to force the
    alternative rendering.</li>
    <li>Increased the descender by a small amount so that second level
    elements are no longer cut off.</li>
    <li>For users of the Tampuan language: coeng-vo after coeng-ro and
    shifting of samyuk before reahmuk are now enabled by default. The
    Tampuan option now only covers the width of space and the permission
    to use samyuk after reahmuk.</li>
    <li>The support for the use of vowels and coengs with independent
    vowels in OS X is limited. If there is a real need for improvement
    please contact the font designer.</li>
    <li>Changed position of quotes (U+2018-9, 201C-D) and mirrored
    U+201C.</li>
